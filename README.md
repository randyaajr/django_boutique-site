### Design
#### Framework
- [Bootstrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/), front-end framework is chosen for this project for its modern interface, ease of use and ability to be easily customized. It is used for creating features such as navbar, cards, forms, modals, as well as for the layout.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is used for initializing some Bootstrap components, as well as for custom functions, DOM manipulation.


#### Icons
Icons are used widely, as they are good attention grabbers. They help users to find and scan content quickly and easily. Another advantage of using them is to help to break language barriers. They create more user-friendly experience for people with non-native English by giving the visual clue about the subject.   
- I used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for social media links, forms, cart, search and user icons in navigation).
